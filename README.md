## Overview and Origin

* WeBull Investment Group

* The comapny was corporated/founded May 24 2017

* The founder of the company are Wang Anquan, who had worked with variouys companies such as Alibaba Finance

* The companies intended target was not only to grab new users but younger investors with their easy-to-use trading platform. There wasn't any information on the market size but in an article in November of 2020, they had added their 1 millionth account to the platform of users.  

* The solution the platform offers that others don't is that WeBull offers a further reach with their grasp on data science and finance. The offering of investing in international markets gave them a strong leg up over the competitor and topping it off with the addition of cryptocurrency in the latter 2020. When the only offering from the competitor (Robinhood) was incremental investments and cryptocurrency.

* I found a few different versions of the technology stacked behind the WeBull platform. Mainly I discoverwed that they used JQUERY, NGINX, GOOGLE ANALYTICS, GOOGLE TAG MANAGER. This was found when I searched Stackshare, when searching awesometechstack.com I was able to locate futher technologies such as REACT, EXPRESS, LINKEDIN INSIGHT TAG, GOOGLE ANALYTICS, MICROSOFT ADVERTISING, NGINX, NODE.JS, MICROSOFT 365, AMAZON CLOUDFRONT, TWITTER ADS, GOOGLE TAG MANAGER, AMAZON WEB SERVICES, ACCESSIBE, MAILGUN


## Landscape:

* The domain that this platform conducts in is Investing and Banking. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? Within the last 5 years, over 88% of incumbent financial institutions believe that their business will be stolen by FinTech companies. Globally fintech companies have acquired $25.6 billion in investments in H1 2020. Digital banking has increased by 46% amongst the people who use them solely for financial needs. 77% of traditional financial institutions have focused or plan to focus on innovations to retain customers, a great example is CHIME. an online banking platform ran by an incumbent financial institution such as JP Morgan Chase. Digital payments grew from $4.1 trillion in 2019 to 5.2 trillion in 2020, a $1.1 trillion in growth in a year. 

* I compiled a list of the top fintech companies who operate inside this domain "Ripple, Coinbase, Robinhood, Chime,  Credit Karma


## Results:

* The impact of WeBull's presence is that it has embraced or capsulized a way to encourage younger investors to join its platform. With options trading, cryptocurrency, money management, international, market trading, forex currency trading, etc. 

* Some of the core methods that assisted Webull set defined goals for brand awareness, consideration, and user acquisition, and then tracked success through specific metrics such as app downloads, account registrations, account top-ups, and top-up value. According to market research, WeBull has grown beyond reason. Something never heard of as an international company also a Chinese company launching in the US

* WeBull is celebrating its 3 year anniversary. They have accumulated over 3 million subscribers and have even taken about a third of the competitors (ROBINHOOD) 13 million customers when they hit a snag between the clearinghouse and the investments when GME and AMC were being shorted.


## Recommendations:

* Upon observation, I would introduce a program I created entitled "U_Invest". A program that would initiate a trading module and cryptocurrency curriculum to students as young as 14, all the way up until collegiate stages. Also, I would offer youth trading and youth trading modules to accompany the learning modules. Encouragement of trading from teenagers and building the knowledge in free beginner courses on the platform for 1st time and early learners.

* It would be beneficial to ensure that the youth can be guided effectively towards a successful life. Beginning with the tools that can help them become financially responsible, could ensure a brighter future. Financial education is something that's insn't in today's learning curriculum outside of advanced studies. Adding that we are bringing a market of investors that haven't been tapped into by this platform. An idea Recently introduced by FIDELITY was to add teen investing, I would do that with the added education to surpass the competition.

* The additional technologies that this product would use, would be the most powerful tool that is used to engage anyone from the ages of 10-25, SOCIAL MEDIA. Social media would be a great tool to use as an everyday platform and not just for advertising purposes. Classes, Live Seminars, Instructional Groups can be a facet of revenue as well be a tool to attract the younger audience that the product is meant to grasp the attention of. 

* This technology would be appropriate for the younger audience due to the fact that the audience has already gravitated to the umbrella that the project would fall under. Social media has a range of fail-safe mechanisms to protect against fraudulence, as well as age consents that are already in place with tools for parents to use at their discretion.
